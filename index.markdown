Allyon Arena is a novel competition where AI "Allyons" (monsters with indirect human control) battle other monsters and solve puzzles in a real-time, dynamic environment. The core idea is that the player has to command and coordinate with its Allyon via voice in order to overcome these challenges as quickly as possible, outperforming all other Human-Allyon pairs!

Participants can bring their own models, or use one of the provided ones. These models or model pipelines should take voice as input and return executable code that conforms to our sandbox API. This creates a unique intersection of natural language processing, real-time gaming, and strategic decision-making.

Detailed information on game rules, game tutorial and frequently asked questions can be found at [Game](game.markdown) page.

We offer two tracks and welcome participants at all levels. To participate, you must sign up for one or both track(s). If you are interested in developing an agent, please check out the guidelines in [Submit AI](submission.markdown) page for *agent development track*. The starter code and training environment can be accessed on GitHub. If you do not wish to submit an agent but are still interested in this competition, please check out the details on the [Play](/play/) page for signing up as a player in the *player track*. We will be hosting a few virtual and in-person matchmaking events to bring players together.

The following video provides an overview to the competition tracks, rules, short game tutorial and information on setting up the training environment. We hope to bring exciting experiences to the participants and exploring critical human-AI teaming questions to gain a better understanding in team communication, coordination, and adaptation.
