Allyon Arena is a new competition where AI "Allyons" (monsters with voice-controlled by human players) solve puzzles and battle other monsters in a real-time, dynamic environment. The core idea is that the player has to command and coordinate with its Allyon via voice in order to overcome challenges as quickly as possible, outperforming all other Human-Allyon pairs!

Participants can bring their own models, or use one of the provided ones. These models or model pipelines should take voice as input and return executable code that conforms to our sandbox API. This creates a unique intersection of natural language processing, real-time gaming, and strategic decision-making.

Detailed information on game rules, game tutorial and frequently asked questions can be found at [Game](game.markdown) page.

We welcome participants to the Allyon Arena speedrun competition. Please check out the details on the [Play](/play/) page for signing up as a player. 
Players will be able to modify the Allyon AI's system prompt to modify its behavior.
