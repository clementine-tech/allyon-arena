## Game Details

The Allyon Arena game is a real-time, dynamic environment where players can command and coordinate with their Allyon via voice. The game is designed to be played in a local environment but connected to the Allyon Arena server to allow for real-time voice transcription and command execution via the Allyon's AI.
Players will be able to modify the Allyon AI's system prompt to modify its behavior.

## How to Play

MacOS, Windows, and Linux builds for Allyon Arena will be available soon.
<!-- Dice Adventure is now available on [itch.io](https://cmu-tact.itch.io/dice-adventure). We will also release a local build of the game for players to explore and for developers to test their agents. You can jump on the game and play at any time from **May 8, 2024** to **July 7, 2024**. The AI agent will be online on **June 15, 2024**. Virtual match making events will be hosted between **July 16, 2024** and **July 27, 2024**. The game supports two play modes --- the *practice* mode and the *competition* mode. In the *practice* mode, you can switch between the three characters to get familiar with the game. The *competition* mode will only be available at match-making events. -->
